Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes
This is a Sentiment Analysis project using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The project uses a dataset of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, where each review is labeled as positive or negative.

Project Features:
Text Preprocessing: The raw text reviews are transformed into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms using CountVectorizer (bag-of-words model).

Model Training: The project uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to train the model on the preprocessed text data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on a test set of movie reviews.

User Input: The user can enter a custom movie review, and the model will predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

Simple Visualization: After the sentiment prediction, the accuracy of the model is displayed in a basic bar chart using Matplotlib.

Tools and Libraries:
Python: The project is implemented in Python, a popular language for machine learning.

Scikit-learn: Used for text vectorization, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the model's accuracy.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling the dataset.

Numpy: Used for numerical computations.

Dataset:
The project uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 labeled reviews (positive and negative). You can download the dataset directly from the IMDB dataset.
